# My Rust Notes

## Important Notes

All rust projects will run from a main function. Just like in C/C++ or Java. Variable in Rust is immutable by default to make them mutable you have use `mut` after the `let` when declaring a varible.

## Rust CLI

- `cargo init`: Intialize a Cargo project in side a floder
- `cargo new <Path> --bin`: Create new Cargo with a given path
- `cargo build`: Create build project from source
- `carog run`: Build and run project from source
- `cargo build --release`: Build project for project
- `rustc --version`: Returing the version of the rust complier installed
- `rustc <File Name>`: Compling a specific rust source file

## Comments

- One line comments are created using `\\`

**Example**

```rust
// Single Line comments
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World");
}
```

- Multi line comments are created using `/* Some comment */`

**Example**

```rust
/*
This
is
a
Multi
line
comment
*/
fn main() {
	println!("Yay for comments");
}
```
