# My Rust Solution on Leetcode Problems

Here's a list of all my solutions I've implemented using Rust. I wanted a way to get comfortable writing in Rust
so I decide to run through problems on leetcode using it. Placing all my solution here for reference so whenever I get
stuck anywhere I come back here to refresh my memory.

## Array Problems

- [1031. Maximum Sum of Two Non-Overlapping Subarrays](./MaximumSumofTwoNon-OverlappingSubarrays.md)

## Stack Problems

- [394. Decode String](./DecodeString.md)

## Greedy Problems

- [1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers](./DivideArrayinSetsofKConsecutiveNumbers.md)

## Sliding Window Problems
